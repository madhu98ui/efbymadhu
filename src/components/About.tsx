            Photography, for me, is about reliving moments.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            It's about freezing a second in time so you can come back to it years later and still feel the same emotion. The laughter, the calm, the excitement, the love.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            I've been doing photography for over four years now, and through travel, weddings*, and nature, I've learned that every moment carries its own story. A quiet sunrise in the mountains, a bride's nervous smile before walking down the aisle, the wind moving through trees. These are the kinds of moments I'm drawn to.

            I don't chase perfection. I chase feeling.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            Whether I'm capturing a couple on their big day, exploring new places, or simply admiring the beauty of nature, my goal is always the same. To create images that feel honest and timeless.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            Photography isn't just something I do.
            <br />
            It's how I hold on to moments that would otherwise pass by.
